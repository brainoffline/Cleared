# BrainOffline - Cleared!
Minimalist Puzzle Game


## Winter of Xamarin
This project is my entry into the [Winter of Xamarin](https://www.microsoftevents.com/profile/web/index.cfm?PKWebId=0x503235b5d1) competition.

Cleared is a Minimalistic Puzzle game where the idea is to clear the board by connecting the colored squared.

There is a shared component where all the game logic.  Each app is written using Xamarin Native. There is a feedback component that allows the customer to send comments.  The back-end for this is in Azure.

I have created a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/3t7IEUB6LqA) of the app running.

And published the App to the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/developer/brian-donovan-smith/id1234554387) (pending approval) as well and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainoffline.cleared).

The source has been release in [GitHub](https://github.com/brainoffline/Cleared) under the MIT license.
